# 3D-textures
Repo for 3D textures that are 3D printable and replicatable for benchmarking a tactile sensor.

Under <a href="https://github.com/shepai/3D-textures/Generator">Generator</a> you can find code to generate the texture blocks. Or use our texture blocks already generated under the <a href="https://github.com/shepai/3D-textures/Generator/objects">objects</a> folder.

Different prints have different qualities depending on the type of filament and printer. We investigate which printers/ filaments do better and look at 

In addition, we have written code for a testing rig to gather the coefficient of friction for each texture. This is seen under friction.
